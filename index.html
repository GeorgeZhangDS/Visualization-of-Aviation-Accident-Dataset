      <h2 class="section">Visualization of Aviation Accident Dataset</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        The 21st century has witnessed rapid economic growth globally, as well
        as closer economic ties between states. As a result, the number of
        passengers requiring air travel has significantly increased,
        highlighting the importance of discussing the significance of data
        visualization in ensuring flight safety. In this project, we aim to
        explore the US flight accident dataset from 2000 to 2023 (Exclude) to
        better understand the factors that impact passenger safety under
        different circumstances. Ultimately, this will enable passengers to make
        informed decisions when selecting flights.

        <h3>
          Does the number of aircraft engines affect the incidence of fatal
          injuries?
        </h3>

        <div id="plot1"></div>
        <p>
          In the scatter plot below, it is apparent that in 21st century
          America, aircraft with two engines seem to have a higher frequency of
          producing fatal injuries in accidents compared to aircraft with a
          different number of engines. The most severe accident was American
          Airlines Flight 587, which according to Wikipedia, crashed near Belle
          Harbor in Queens, New York shortly after taking off from JFK
          International Airport on November 12, 2001, resulting in 251
          passengers, 9 crew members, and 5 residents on the ground for a total
          of 265 fatalities. However, this accident is just an outlier, as most
          of the data points are clustered around zero. Out of several thousands
          of accidents and incidents, only a small number of flights have
          resulted in serious injuries or fatalities.

      <h3>
        What are the top 10 aircraft brands with the highest number of fatal
        injuries?
      </h3>

      <div id="plot2"></div>
      <p>
        Based on the second chart, it's apparent that "Cessna," "Piper,"
        "Beechcraft," "Boeing," "Bell," "Airbus Industries," "Mooney,"
        "Robinson," "Cirrus Design Corp," and "Douglas" are the ten aircraft
        manufacturers that have caused the most fatal injuries. However, out of
        these manufacturers, Cessna, Piper, and Beechcraft are responsible for
        the most fatalities, and they're known for specializing in the
        production of small general aviation aircraft. Although other companies
        are also listed, it's notable that these three firms have a
        significantly higher number of fatalities caused by their planes. Cessna
        is headquartered in Wichita, Kansas, while Piper is located in Florida.
        Beechcraft, which is based in Kansas, produces a variety of aircraft,
        including single- and twin-engine piston planes, turboprops, and
        business jets. It's worth mentioning that most of the aircraft produced
        by these companies are small-sized.

      <h3>
        What is the variation of aviation accidents by month between 2000 and
        2023?

        According to the Stacked Chart, it's evident that with the advancement
        of technology, aircraft manufacturers are now better equipped to provide
        passengers with a safer travel experience, resulting in a gradual
        decline in the number of accidents each year. From 2000 to 2023
        (excluding the latter year), the top three years with the highest number
        of aviation accidents were 2000, 2003, and 2001, while the years 2020,
        2021, and 2022 had the lowest number of accidents. This indicates that
        in today's globalized world, there has been an exponential growth in
        demand for air travel, prompting airlines to continuously improve and
        research flight safety. By examining the twelve months of the year, it's
        observed that accidents mostly occur during the summer months, with July
        and August having a higher number of aviation accidents compared to
        other months.

        What is the difference in the number of aviation accidents among US
        states?
      </h3>

      <div id="plot4"></div>
      <p>
        Based on the Geomap chart, it is clear that most flight accidents occur
        in three highly populated Southern states: California, Texas, and
        Florida. These states are also the three most populous states in the US.
        New York, which is the fourth most populous state and has a population
        slightly smaller than Florida, ranks considerably lower in terms of
        flight incident frequency.

      <h3>
        What is the distribution of fatal and serious injuries based on damage
        type?
      </h3>

      <div id="plot5"></div>
      <p>
        The fifth chart shows that the number of people who sustain serious
        injuries is similar when an aircraft experiences destroyed or
        substantial damage, but higher compared to when it sustains only minor
        damage. Specifically, the median number of seriously injured people is
        close to 7 when an aircraft is destroyed, which is similar to
        substantial damage. However, when the aircraft experiences minor damage,
        the median number of seriously injured people is close to 2.
        Additionally, in cases where the aircraft incurs only minor damage, the
        number of injuries resulting from the accident is typically close to 0.
        Based on thousands of flight accidents, it is evident that passengers
        are relatively safe even if the aircraft sustains only minor damage, as
        long as the damage is not severe or catastrophic.

      <h3>Are aviation accidents/incidents related to weather conditions?</h3>

      <div id="plot6"></div>
      <p>
        VMC and IMC are terms used in aviation to describe different weather
        conditions and visibility that pilots may encounter during flight. The
        key difference between VMC and IMC in aviation is that VMC refers to
        flight conditions in which pilots can operate the aircraft by visual
        references, while IMC refers to flight conditions in which pilots must
        rely solely on instrument readings to navigate and control the aircraft.
        According to the pie chart in our sixth graph, it is evident that most
        flight accidents occur in high visibility weather conditions, and only a
        small proportion of flight accidents occur in IMC weather conditions.
