# Visualization-of-Aviation-Accident-Dataset
Individual Project: Yixuan Zhang
---------------------------------------------------------------
In the 21st century, the global economy has grown rapidly, leading to closer economic ties between countries. As a result, the number of passengers needing to travel by plane has significantly increased, highlighting the importance of data visualization in ensuring flight safety. In this project, we utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and D3.js to explore the dataset of U.S. flight accidents from 2000 to 2022, aiming to better understand the factors affecting passenger safety under different circumstances. Ultimately, this will enable passengers to make informed decisions when choosing flights.
